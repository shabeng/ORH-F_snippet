My theis concerns a ride-hailing system  

This repo includes the following parts:
1. Creating the instances of the ride hailing system, using the CityNetwork and ProblemObjects.
2. Solving the offline variation of the problem with one of my MILP models, using the CPLEX api for python. 
3. Solving the online problem with the dispatching rules, which were the benchmark in my thesis.
